# House Price Prediction with Linear Regression

## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for implementing a linear regression model to predict house prices based on square footage, the number of bedrooms, and bathrooms. The goal is to provide a simple yet effective solution for predicting house prices using a straightforward linear regression approach.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (optional but recommended for interactive exploration)

You can install the required Python packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model is stored in the `data` directory. It includes the following columns:

- `SquareFootage`: The square footage of the house.
- `Bedrooms`: The number of bedrooms in the house.
- `Bathrooms`: The number of bathrooms in the house.
- `Price`: The target variable, representing the price of the house.

Make sure to update the dataset or use your own dataset with similar columns if needed.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/house-price-prediction.git
   cd house-price-prediction
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**

   If you want to interactively explore the data and model, you can use the provided Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook house_price_prediction.ipynb
   ```

   Open the notebook in your browser and run each cell step by step.


## Results

The trained model's performance and evaluation metrics will be displayed in the Jupyter Notebook or printed to the console when running the Python script.

Feel free to experiment with the model hyperparameters, feature engineering, or try different regression algorithms to improve the prediction accuracy.
